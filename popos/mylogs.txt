 This is a log of my activities on Linux :
 
********************** Beginning of log ************************                     

I installed an application called "exa" which is like "ls"
However this application does not working in Linux properly because "git" is not enable by default in linux
SO if you install it using "apt instal" it will not display some flag with -git in it


So I had to build it file using CARGO
Cargo stores all its binary files in  HOME/.cargo/bin
SO I had to include this in the profile path of my bash which loads up when we start the computer.
This is in "/etc/profile"

The following path is saved in (above location) Permanently 
PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"

If I want to temporarily save this path, type (below) in terminal : 
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"

so here I have added fonts to the OS.
Until today I didn't know, how the terminal was show all these fonts.
Now I know !
So what happens if the you save the font in ~/.usr/share/font : This is for local user
This is for system wide user ~/.local/share/fonts  OR  /usr/local/share/fonts (both for system wide)
You can download fonts from "Font Awesome" website Here you find "Nerdfonts" 
Another font I downloaded was called "Meslo" not related to font awesome

Then you basically sudo apt install the font or you manually, 'cp' the font folder to "~user/share/fonts" ( for system wide ) OR /usr/local/share/fonts (for SYSTEM wide)

Now you open the config file of your terminal and from preferences you basically change the font to one of the above for e.g. choose "Meslo" in the preferences.

Your terminal will automatically start showing the fonts.
